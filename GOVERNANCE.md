# Strimzi Governance

This document defines project governance for the Strimzi project.

## Project Roles

### Maintainers

The maintainers are responsible for the overall development of the whole Strimzi project and all its components.
The maintainers are identified in the [`MAINTAINERS`](MAINTAINERS) file. 

#### Changes in Maintainership

New maintainers are proposed by an existing maintainer and are elected by a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.
Maintainers can be removed by a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.

#### Github Project Administration

Maintainers will be added to the collaborators list of the Strimzi repository with "Write" access.
After 6 months a maintainer will be given "Admin" access to the Strimzi repository.

### Component owners

The component owners are responsible for development of a specific subproject or component within Strimzi.
Such components might be represented by a separate GitHub repository within the Strimzi organization (e.g. `strimzi-kafka-bridge`) or by a subdirectory in a GitHub repository (e.g. `./documentation/` in `strimzi-kafka-operator`).
The components owners are identified in the [`COMPONENT-OWNERS`](COMPONENT-OWNERS) file in this repository which also includes the component for which they are responsible.

By definition, every maintainer is also an owner for all components and does not have to be mentioned in the `OWNERS` list.

#### Changes in component ownership

New component owners can be proposed by any maintainer and are elected by a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.
Component owners can be removed by a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.

#### Github Project Administration

Owners of components which have their own GitHub repository will get "Write" rights for given GitHub repository and will be able to merge approved PRs.
Owners will not get "Admin" rights on any Strimzi GitHub repositories.

## Voting

The Strimzi project employs voting to ensure no single member can dominate the project.

For formal votes, a specific statement of what is being voted on should be added to the relevant GitHub issue or PR.
Voters should indicate their yes/no vote on that issue or PR, and after a suitable period of time, the votes will be tallied and the outcome noted.

### Approving PRs

PRs may be merged after receiving at least two positive maintainer votes.
Voting for PRs can be done using a comment in the PR or by approving (or requesting changes) the PR.
If the PR author is a maintainer, this counts as a vote.

PRs which affect only a single component can be approved by at least one positive maintainer vote and one positive vote from an owner of given component.
If the PR author is a maintainer or an owner of given component, this counts as a vote.

### Proposals

Proposals can be opened against the [proposals repository](https://github.com/strimzi/proposals).
Proposals should cover any changes to the Strimzi project which might significantly impact its users or the project direction.
Proposals are approved by a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.

### Changes in Governance

All changes in Governance require a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.

### Other Changes

Unless specified above, all other changes to the project require a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.
Additionally, any maintainer may request that any change require a ⅔ majority maintainers vote.
