# Responsibilities of a Strimzi Maintainer

The [governance](GOVERNANCE.md) document is quite terse about what the duties of a maintainer are. 
It says:

> The maintainers are responsible for the overall development of the whole Strimzi project and all its components.

That is, by intention, not prescriptive because it is simply impossible to foresee how maintainers might need to interpret their responsibility to the project (and ultimately, to the community) in all possible circumstances.
Or, in other words, the governance grants maintainers considerable liberty in how they interpret their responsibility for the good of the project.

The governance also grants maintainers a few ways to do fulfil their duty which other roles within the project do not have:

* Approving PRs. Maintainers can approve PRs which span components;
  component owners cannot. No PR can be merged with only component owner approvals.
* Voting on proposals:

    > Votes [on proposals] from maintainers are binding and count towards the approval of the proposal.
 
This document seeks to elaborate (without being prescriptive) on what the maintainers expect of other maintainers.

0. To follow, and when necessary enforce, the governance and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) documents.

1. To act in good faith and in the best interests of the project as a whole, taking due consideration of its users and contributors.

> This is perhaps the hardest responsibility to elaborate on without getting into what counts as 'good faith', 'best interests', etc.
> There is an emphasis on 'the project as a whole' and 'users and contributors'.
> Note that the interests of maintainers themselves, or their employers, are not explicitly included.
> But note that maintainers should take into consideration indirect users of Strimzi
> such as those who depend on it via a vendor (who may or may not be an employer of a maintainer), offering products or services built on Strimzi.
   
2. Provide leadership of the project beyond the code.

> This is to be interpretted widely, and may include things such as:
> * advocacy on behalf of the project
> * mentoring and proposing community members for roles within the project
> * interfacing with CNCF on behalf of the project
> * periodically reviewing the goverence rules to ensure they're still fit for purpose
> * helping contributors participate in the project

3. To the extent that they're able, to contribute to the project by reviewing proposals and PRs.

> To be clear, there is no on-going committment to do this indefinitely.
> Being a maintainer is not a burden to be carried forever more.
> This expectation is simply a consequence of the governance rules that only certain things can be done by maintainers.
> For the project to make progress such things must be done.
